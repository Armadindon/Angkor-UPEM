    <h2>What to visit </h2>
    <p>The Cambodgian is overflowing of places to visit. </p>
    <p>Here is a list of things to do in Cambodgia.</p>
    <h3>Sbek Thom, a Khmer shadow theater</h3>
    <p>Registered in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008, this Khmer theatre features non-articulated puppets, made of carved leather, sometimes reaching a height of 2m. Dating from the pre-Angkorian period and considered a sacred art, these puppet performances were once dedicated to the deities, and they were only given three or four times a year. After the fall of Angkor in the fifteenth century, shadow theatre went beyond ritual to become an artistic form, but without losing its ceremonial dimension.
      Representations are usually taking place at night, outdoors, near a scribble or a pagoda. A white sheet is tightened with two bamboo sticks in front of lights. The shapes of the dolls are
projected in chinese shadow on a white screen. The artist is giving life to these shadows by doing some dance steps, an orchestra and two narrators are supporting the dramatic action. These representations can last for many consecutive nights and use 160 dolls for the same show.

    <h3>The Royal Cambodian Ballet</h3>
    <p>Registered in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008, this Khmer art is renowned for the gracious gestures and gorgeous outfits. More than just a simple dance, this art is part of the history and the identity of the Cambodian people. This art form, which narrowly escaped annihilation in the 1970s, is in fact revered by many Cambodians.
Dance, with its sacred and symbolic role, embodies the traditional values of refinement, respect and spirituality. His repertory immortalizes the founding legends of the Khmer people. That is why Cambodians have always considered it as the emblem of Khmer culture. The classical repertoire includes four types of characters: Neang the woman, Neayrong the man, Yeak the giant and Sva the monkey. Each one has its own colours, costumes, make-up and masks. The gestures and postures, which require years of intensive training to master, reflect the full range of human emotions, from fear and rage to love and joy. An orchestra accompanies the dance, while a women's choir comments on the plot and highlights the emotions mimicked by the dancers.
