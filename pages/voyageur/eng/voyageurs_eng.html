      <h3>Louis Delaporte (1842-1925)</h3>
      <img src="../../../CSS/Images/voyageurs/louis.jpg" class="img">
      <p class="gras">Who was he  ?</p>
<p>French explorer of the 19th century, it was very young that he decided to become a sailor. To make this aspiration a reality,
  he joined the Naval School in Brest in 1858. Appointed midshipman two years later, he embarked on his first expedition to Mexico.</p>

<p class="gras">Why is he related to Angkor ?</p>
<p>Recruited in 1866 for the French Expedition in the Mekong (mission to explore and search for the sources of the river), it was on this occasion that he discovered the Angkor site.
The discovery of these forgotten ruins deeply upset Delaporte and he decided to dedicate his life to making this civilization known, which he compared to the greatness of the ancient Egyptian civilization.
Having become passionate about Angkor since his exhibition in Cambodia, he brought back a large variety of objects of the Khmer empire from his various expeditions (1866 to 1882).
At the end of his career, as he could no longer go on expeditions, he devoted his time to the Khmer Museum in Compiègne, where he worked as a curator.

<p class="italic">"I could not contemplate these monuments... without feeling the strong desire to make them known to Europe and to enrich our museums with a collection of Khmer antiquities whose place belong next to those of Egypt and Assyria."

  <h3>André Malraux (1901-1976)</h3>
  <img src="../../../CSS/Images/voyageurs/malraux.jpg" class="img">
  <p class="gras">Who was he ?</p>

<p>Writer, politician and adventurer, he is considered as one of the greatest consciences of the 20th century.</p>

<p class="gras">Why is he related to Angkor ?</p>

<p>On October 13, 1923, André Malraux left for Siem Reap with his wife, Clara Malraux. Nevertheless, it was not just as a tourist but to steal bas-reliefs from Angkor and sell them in the West to make up for his lack of money. Once there, Malraux and his expedition team detached nearly a ton of carved stones and four large pieces of bas-reliefs. Back in Angkor, they were reported to the police, who sentenced them to three years in prison.  His sentence will then be reduced to one year and eight months of suspended jail.</p>

<p>French explorer and naturalist. After reading Sir John Bowring's (1857) The Kingdom and People of Siam: with a narrative of a mission to that country in 1855,
he decided to discover Siam, Cambodia and Laos. During his expedition to Cambodia he met and became a friend of the kings of Cambodia Ang Duong, who ruled until 1860, and then of Norodom.
During the years 1859 - 1860, he explored and had the Angkor site rediscovered in the eyes of the West.

    <h3>Pierre Loti (1850-1923)</h3>

    <p class="gras">Who was he ?</p>

<p>Novelist and Naval Officer.

As a child, Pierre Loti dreamed of seeing the city of Angkor. It was only long after that he realized his dream
when he travelled around the world as a sailor. In 1900, he was assigned to the battleship "Redoutable" and it was during a stopover
in 1901 that he moored on the Cambodian coast.</p>
<p class="gras">Quote :</p>
<p class="italic">"These colossal enclosures and its towers, which have just appeared to us like a mirage of the torrid heat, are not the same city,
  but only Angkor-Vat, its main temple. The city, Angkor Thom, we hear that it is located further, immense and imprecise, buried under the tropical forest."
